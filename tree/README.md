# Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
Build upon our BinaryTree class

## Challenge
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Approach & Efficiency
* I created a variable called maxValue with a value of 0. I then iterated through the tree, checking each node value and replacing the maxValue if the current node is greater then what is in maxValue.
* The Big O for Space is O(n), and the big O for time is O(n).
* Tests are run by entering 'npm run test' on the command line.
