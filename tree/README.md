# Trees

Buiding Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees

## Challenge

Traverse through the Binary Trees using the preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder methods.  Add and search through Binary Search Trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

PreOrder, inOrder, and postOrder methods use regular traversal methods.  Add and Search cut the binary searcg tree in half with each step resulting in a big O of O(logN)

## API

* The preOrder method starts at the root then goes left then right.
* The inOrder method starts at the left side then the root and then the right side.
* The postOrder method starts at the left, then the right and the root last.
